# vaked-pr-review

An advisory CI **PR-review agent** built on [adk-rust]. It reads a pull
request's diff via `gh`, reviews it with a non-frontier **OpenRouter** model
(GLM-4.6 by default — no Codex-style usage/credit limits), and posts **one
structured, advisory-only review comment**. It never blocks a merge: any failure
logs and exits 0.

This is the first inhabitant of `vaked-agents/` — the home for the Vaked agent
fleet. `ci/` is the CI-bot subtree. **Backlog / roadmap:** [`../BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md).

## What makes it good, not sloppy

- **Seven-hat council** in the system prompt — PL researcher · nix/zig/rust/python
  · systems architect · security & capability auditor · compiler/type-systems ·
  OTP/BEAM supervision · protocol/wire-format — each lens tuned to the Vaked stack.
- **Caveman output contract** — verdict line + grouped findings (`Blocking /
  Major / Minor / Nit`), each `path:line — problem; fix`, no preamble, no praise,
  no hedging. Clean diff ⇒ `**Verdict:** No blocking issues.` and nothing else.
- **crabcc over MCP** — the repo's own symbol index ([crabcc-labs/crabcc]) is
  wired in as an adk-rust `McpToolset` (`crabcc --mcp`), so the model resolves
  definitions/references beyond the diff. The on-disk `.crabcc/` index is reused
  (refreshed, not rebuilt) and cached across CI runs.
- **RTK token-killer** — when [rtk-ai/rtk] is present, the single-pass diff is
  fetched condensed (`rtk git diff base...head`, 60–90% fewer tokens); falls back
  to plain unified diff / `gh pr diff`.
- **High reasoning** — GLM-4.6 runs at `effort: high` (best lens for catching
  logic/edge/security bugs), wired through the OpenRouter extension on
  `GenerateContentConfig`. Overridable via `PR_REVIEW_REASONING_EFFORT`.
- **Map-reduce for large PRs (parallel)** — above `PR_REVIEW_MAPREDUCE_LINES`
  (default 600) changed lines, each file is reviewed independently —
  `PR_REVIEW_CONCURRENCY` (default 6) at a time — then a synthesis pass dedupes
  and groups into the final review.
- **Tiered reasoning** — per-file passes run at `effort: medium` (mechanical),
  the final/synthesis pass at `high` — large-PR speed without losing the deep pass.
- **Structured output + caveman prose** — the final pass returns strict JSON
  (`verdict` / `findings[]` / `prose` / `exceptions`) rendered to markdown: exact
  finding counts for the status, blunt prose for humans. Falls back to raw text if
  a provider returns non-conforming output. Disable with `PR_REVIEW_NO_STRUCTURED`.
- **Prompt caching** — a stable cache key + identical system-prompt prefix let
  OpenRouter cache the prefix; cached tokens are recorded in usage / Langfuse.
- **Secret redaction (pre-send guardrail)** — likely credentials are scrubbed
  from the diff before it ever reaches the model.
- **`read_lines` tool** — a native read-only Rust `FunctionTool` so the model can
  pull exact surrounding context crabcc's symbol index doesn't cover.
- **Noise filtering** — lockfiles, generated, and binary paths are excluded from
  the diff (git pathspec + post-filter) before the model ever sees them.
- **Language-conditional checklists** — Nix/Zig/Rust/Python/EBNF/OTP checklists
  injected only for the file types actually in the diff.
- **Replace, don't stack** — each run deletes its prior `<!-- vaked-pr-review -->`
  comment and posts one fresh review; an **advisory commit status** carries the
  finding count (never fails the check).
- **Langfuse tracing** — OTLP/HTTP spans per run, with `changed_lines`, `mode`,
  `total_tokens`, `thinking_tokens`, and `findings` recorded as span attributes.
- **Eval harness** — `--eval <dir>` scores the reviewer against `*.diff`/`*.expect`
  fixtures (see `evals/`).
- **Resilience** — OpenRouter provider fallback (`allow_fallbacks`), bounded tool
  retries, and a supply-chain audit (`cargo-deny`/`cargo-audit`) that runs only on
  agent **version bumps** (`pr-review-audit.yml`).
- Bounded tool loop (`PR_REVIEW_MAX_ITERS`, 60s tool timeout) + 25-min CI cap,
  low temperature + fixed seed, opt-out label, and empty-diff skip.

## Cold start (baking)

`pr-review-build.yml` compiles the release binary once on `main` and publishes it
as a rolling GitHub Release asset (`pr-review-bin`). `pr-review.yml` downloads
that prebuilt binary per PR instead of compiling adk-rust (~2 min) every time. If
the asset is missing — or the PR changes the agent's own source — it builds from
source as a fallback (dogfooding stays honest), accelerated by `sccache` + the
`mold` linker (swap to `wild` by changing the setup action + `-fuse-ld`). The
release profile (thin-LTO, `strip`, `panic=abort`) + rustls (no system OpenSSL)
keep the baked binary ~10 MB; the agent runs on the **mimalloc** global allocator.

## Secrets (repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions)

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | yes | OpenRouter API key (the model call) |
| `LANGFUSE_URL` | optional | Self-hosted Langfuse base, e.g. `https://langfuse.internal` |
| `LANGFUSE_API_KEY` | optional | OTLP Basic token: **base64 of `<public_key>:<secret_key>`** |
| `CRABCC_INSTALL_TOKEN` | optional | PAT with `crabcc-labs/crabcc` read access (CI installs crabcc) |

Missing optional secrets degrade gracefully: no Langfuse ⇒ untraced; no crabcc ⇒
diff-only review.

## Env / overrides

| Var | Default | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `PR_REVIEW_MODEL` | `z-ai/glm-4.6` | any OpenRouter model id |
| `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | self-host / proxy |
| `PR_REVIEW_MAX_DIFF_CHARS` | `48000` | diff budget before truncation |
| `PR_REVIEW_API_KEY` | — | takes precedence over `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `CRABCC_BIN` | `crabcc` | crabcc binary path |
| `RTK_BIN` | `rtk` | rtk binary path |
| `PR_REVIEW_NO_RTK` | — | set to disable rtk diff compression |
| `BASE_SHA` / `HEAD_SHA` | — | PR base/head for the diff range (CI sets these) |
| `PR_REVIEW_REASONING_EFFORT` | `high` | OpenRouter reasoning effort (`low`/`medium`/`high`) |
| `PR_REVIEW_MAPREDUCE_LINES` | `600` | changed-line threshold to switch to map-reduce |
| `PR_REVIEW_MAX_FINDINGS` | `20` | cap on findings in the final review |
| `PR_REVIEW_CRABCC_BUDGET` | `8` | max crabcc tool calls the model may make |
| `PR_REVIEW_MAX_ITERS` | `12` | max agent tool-loop iterations |
| `PR_REVIEW_CONCURRENCY` | `6` | parallel per-file passes (map-reduce) + tool concurrency |
| `PR_REVIEW_NO_STRUCTURED` | — | set to disable structured JSON output |
| `PR_REVIEW_TRACE_PAYLOADS` | — | set to record prompt/response payloads into Langfuse spans |

## Eval

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... \
  cargo run --manifest-path vaked-agents/ci/pr-review/Cargo.toml -- \
  --eval vaked-agents/ci/pr-review/evals
```

## Local dry-run (prints the review, posts nothing)

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
cargo run --manifest-path vaked-agents/ci/pr-review/Cargo.toml -- \
  --repo peterlodri-sec/vaked-base --pr <N> --dry-run
```

Add `LANGFUSE_URL` + `LANGFUSE_API_KEY` to verify a `vaked-ci-reviewer` trace
appears in Langfuse. `gh` must be authenticated (`gh auth status`).
