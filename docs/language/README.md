# Vaked Language Track

Vaked is a proposed typed, flake-native complement language for Nix.

It began as a way to make flake definitions, engines, and runtime declarations easier to author. It has now expanded into a capability graph language for agentic, native, mesh-aware, parallel systems.

## Current definition

Vaked is a **flake-native capability graph language** for declaring reproducible agentic, native, mesh-aware, parallel systems.

It compiles to:

- ordinary `flake.nix`
- NixOS modules
- Zig daemon configs
- eBPF policy manifests
- MCP broker configs
- OpenTelemetry config
- CrabCC indexes/catalogs
- generated documentation

## Core top-level declarations

```text
runtime
input
system
engine
host
network
filesystem
mcp
ebpf
budget
observability
runclass
workflow
index
catalog
stream
fiber
surface
mesh
device
mediaPipeline
parallel
```

## Grammar

The normative EBNF grammar and its design notes are in
[`vaked/grammar/README.md`](../../vaked/grammar/README.md) (currently **v0.3**).

## Type system (Goal 2)

The Vaked type system — structural typing + per-kind schema contracts, a
**closed** constraint set, a typed capability taxonomy with an attenuation
partial order (POLA checked at type-time), bounded generics, and a total +
deterministic checking pipeline (parse → resolve → elaborate → check, *validate
before generating*) — is specified normatively in
[`0011-type-system.md`](./0011-type-system.md). Its built-in schema and
capability catalog is [`vaked/schema/parallel-types.md`](../../vaked/schema/parallel-types.md);
worked type-layer examples are in [`vaked/examples/types/`](../../vaked/examples/types/).
